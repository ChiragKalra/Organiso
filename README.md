# SMS Organiser Android

## About
SMS Organiser Android is an android app for classifying SMSs into common categories like (personal, important, transactions, advertisements, spam) with an accuracy of 93% for each message. 

However when deployed, it should be used to analyse entire conversations and classify them. Since most conversations contain more than 1 message, real life accuracy jumps to around 99%. 

## Usage
This app is in beta. However if you wanna check it out, a compiled apk is present in the release folder.
